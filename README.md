# ML_project

This repository contains the scripts written for an internship project at the Dutch royal meteorological institure (In Dutch: Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut, or KNMI) to predict road temperatures. Based on measurements of road temperature and meteorological/environmental variables a model is developed to predict road temperatures for all major roads in the Netherlands. To build the model(s) for predicting road temperature we make use of machine learning. An accurate road temperature model used in combination with weather prediction could be used to predict icy roads. Accurate prediction of icy roads allows for early spraying of salt on roads, preventing them from becoming slippery, and thus helping to prevent accidents.
