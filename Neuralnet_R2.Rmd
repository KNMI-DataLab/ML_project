First clear your working environment and install all necessary packages

```{r}
rm(list=ls())

# Install packages
#install.packages("caret")

```

Now load in the test and train sets and split them into target and predictor sets

```{r}
# Load train
load("/usr/people/kleingel/Projects/MLProject/Train_BIG_noCat.Rda")

# Load test
load("/usr/people/kleingel/Projects/MLProject/Test_BIG_noCat.Rda")

# Split train set into target and predictors 
Target_Train <- Train_set$TRoad
Train_set <- subset(Train_set, select=-c(TRoad))

# Split test set into target and predictors
Target_Test <- Test_set$TRoad
Test_set <- subset(Test_set, select = -c(TRoad))

```

# Build a neural network with neuralnet

Here I build a neural network with the neuralnet package and caret 

```{r}
library(caret)
library(doParallel)
library(parallel)
library(neuralnet)

cluster_1<-makeCluster(3)
registerDoParallel(cluster_1)
getDoParWorkers()

NeuralNetw <- train(x  = Train_set, 
                     y = Target_Train, 
                     method = "neuralnet", 
                     hidden = c(3), 
                     linear.output = TRUE,
                     lifesign = 'minimal')

stopCluster(cluster)
registerDoSEQ()











```
